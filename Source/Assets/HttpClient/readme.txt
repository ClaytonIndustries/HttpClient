When building for mono based platforms and using HTTPS, you may encounter certificate exceptions as mono does not include root certificates by default.
You can add the follow code to automatically accept all certificates or customise it to add your own validation.

System.Net.ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback += (o, certificate, chain, errors) =>
{
    return true;
};
